## Mission Accomplished

Comprehensive research completed on the Controls Description Language (CDL) specification, CDL-JSON format, and Python implementation requirements. All findings have been documented and stored in the collective memory for use by other hive agents.

## Key Findings Overview

### 1. CDL Specification Summary

**What is CDL?**
- Declarative, block-diagram-based language for building automation control sequences
- Based on Modelica subset with strict constraints for control logic
- Being standardized through ASHRAE Standard 231P
- Designed for vendor-independent control sequence representation

**Core Concepts**:
- **Block Types**: Elementary (130+ built-in), Composite (user-defined), Extension (custom implementations)
- **Execution Model**: Synchronous data flow, event-based, zero-time computation
- **Type System**: Real, Boolean, Integer with units and constraints
- **Connection Rules**: Strict acyclic dependency graph, single assignment rule

**Key Innovation**: Enables control logic sharing from design to deployment across different building automation systems

### 2. CDL-JSON Format Details

**Purpose**: Intermediate machine-readable format for translation and interoperability

**Translation Architecture**:
```
CDL (.mo files) → modelica-json → CDL-JSON → {
    - Building Automation Systems
    - Point Lists
    - Documentation
    - CXF (JSON-LD)
}
```

**Schema**:
- Location: https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-json/blob/master/schema-cdl.json
- Validates structure, types, connections
- Enforces standards compliance

**Output Formats**:
1. **Raw JSON**: Complete with all metadata
2. **Simplified JSON**: Streamlined for parsing
3. **CXF (JSON-LD)**: ASHRAE 231P exchange format with linked data

### 3. Control eXchange Format (CXF)

**Specification**: ASHRAE 231P standard exchange format using JSON-LD

**Key Features**:
- Shares 130+ elementary function definitions with CDL
- RDF/linked-data compatible for semantic web integration
- CXF-Core.jsonld defines all standard blocks and types
- Supports vendor-specific annotations and extensions

**Translation**: Uses modelica-json tool for CDL → CXF conversion

### 4. Python Implementation Requirements

**Recommended Architecture**: **Hybrid Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Leverage modelica-json (Node.js) for CDL parsing
- **Phase 2**: Build native Python object model, execution engine, and API
- **Phase 3**: Optionally replace with pure Python parser later

**Why Hybrid?**
- Faster time to market
- Standards compliance guaranteed
- Focus Python effort on high-value areas
- Production-ready parser available

**Technology Stack**:
```python
Required:
- pydantic (2.0+)      # Data validation and serialization
- jsonschema (4.0+)    # JSON schema validation
- networkx (3.0+)      # Dependency graph operations
- typing-extensions    # Extended type hints

Optional:
- rdflib               # CXF/JSON-LD support
- numpy                # Numerical operations
- lark                 # Future native parser

Development:
- uv                   # Package management
- ruff                 # Linting
- pyright              # Type checking
- pytest               # Testing
```

**Layered Architecture**:
1. **Parser Layer**: Wrapper for modelica-json + JSON loader
2. **Object Model Layer**: Blocks, connectors, parameters, types (Pydantic models)
3. **Execution Engine**: Dependency graph, topological sort, event processing
4. **Translation Layer**: CDL-JSON/CXF export, schema validation
5. **High-Level API**: Builder pattern for intuitive control sequence design

### 5. Implementation Challenges

**Technical Challenges**:
1. **Modelica Parsing** (HIGH) → Mitigated by using modelica-json
2. **Dependency Graph** (MEDIUM) → Use networkx with topological sort
3. **Type System** (MEDIUM) → Pydantic validation with custom types
4. **Event Execution** (HIGH) → Build dedicated execution engine
5. **Schema Compliance** (LOW) → jsonschema library

**Standards Compliance**:
- Must support all 130+ elementary functions
- Strict CXF JSON-LD format adherence
- Complete metadata preservation
- Single assignment rule enforcement
- Acyclic dependency validation

### 8. API Design Philosophy

**Pythonic and Intuitive**:
```python
from python_cdl import CDLSequence, blocks

# Create sequence with builder pattern
sequence = CDLSequence("PIDController")
sequence.add_parameter("k", 1.0, description="Proportional gain")
sequence.add_input("setpoint", description="Target temperature")
sequence.add_output("control_signal", description="Output to actuator")

# Add blocks
pid = sequence.add_block(blocks.PID(name="pid", k="k"))

# Connect
sequence.connect("setpoint", "pid.u_s")
sequence.connect("pid.y", "control_signal")

# Validate and export
sequence.validate()
sequence.export_json("controller.json")
sequence.export_cxf("controller_cxf.jsonld")
```

**Execution API**:
```python
from python_cdl import load_sequence, ExecutionEngine

# Load and execute
sequence = load_sequence("controller.mo")
engine = ExecutionEngine(sequence)
engine.initialize()

outputs = engine.step({"setpoint": 23.0, "measured": 20.0})
print(f"Control signal: {outputs['control_signal']}")
```

## Executive Summary for Hive

**CDL is a declarative control language** for building automation being standardized through ASHRAE 231P. It uses a **Modelica subset** with **130+ elementary blocks** for expressing control sequences in a **vendor-independent** format.

**CDL-JSON is the intermediate format** enabling translation between CDL and various target systems (automation platforms, documentation, semantic models). It uses **JSON Schema** for validation and supports **CXF (JSON-LD)** export for linked data integration.

**Python implementation should use a hybrid approach**: Leverage the **modelica-json tool** for parsing while building a **native Python object model** using **Pydantic** for type safety, **NetworkX** for dependency graphs, and custom execution engine for event-based computation.

**12-week roadmap** with clear phases ensures systematic development from foundation through testing. Focus on **standards compliance**, **type safety**, and **Pythonic API design**.

**Success depends on**: Proper use of Pydantic for validation, strict schema compliance, comprehensive testing against Buildings library examples, and maintainable architecture supporting future extensions.
